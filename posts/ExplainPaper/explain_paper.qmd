Today I tried out the **Explain Paper** AI tool to aid in research.  It may have features that helps summarize papers at various levels of complexity for parts of the papers at a time, but at the moment, I simply wanted a tool that summarized whole papers.

Instead, I think that I will simply focus on the abstracts of the papers.
