This is the first post in a Quarto blog. Welcome!

Today I followed Albert Rapp's [guide](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide.html) to creating a Quarto blog.

For me, it was a matter of making

-   a GitHub repository, called it `quartoblog`, and cloned it to my computer
-   deleted the `quartoblog` folder on my computer
-   started a *new* `project` in RStudio to select `Quarto web site` (note that Quarto is already bundled in newer versions of the RStudio IDE)
- got `Netlify` and `GitHub` to play nicely with each other and share the `quartoblog` repository
- updated my domain redirect to the `Netlify` site
