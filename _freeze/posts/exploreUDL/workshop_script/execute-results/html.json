These exercises are adapted from ideas from *Choosing to See: A Framework for Equity in the Math Classroom* by Pamela Seda and\nKyndall Brown.\n\n## Pre-Reading\n\nAudience members would perhaps like to read the following passages from Choosing to See by Pamela Seda and Kyndall Brown, and mentally give themselves time to ponder the ideas.\n\n“The culturally relevant teacher, however, does not view knowledge as static, but rather as continuously re-created and shared by both teacher and student.  In this approach, teachers should look for opportunities where they can play the dual roles of student and co-teacher.  One way of making a class less teacher-centered is by striving to never say anything kids can say for themselves.” --- page 29\n\n“Because mathematics tends to be perceived as difficult, these negative stereotypes contribute to the social status, expert status, academic status, and peer status attributed to students.  Further contributing to unequal status interactions is the idea that mathematics is static, genetic, and/or innate.  Members of negatively stereotyped groups will more likely be perceived as incompetent or incapable when they make mistakes in class” --- page 56\n\n“Culturally relevant relationships are, by contrast, fluid, humane, and equitable.  In culturally relevant classrooms, teachers and students co-construct academic and behavioral norms and hold each other accountable for maintaining those norms.  Culturally relevant teachers encourage connections with all students, emphasize collaboration, and establish communities of learners.  Students work on real-world activities and projects that foster interdependence and allow students to use their community-based knowledge to solve problems” --- page 71\n\n## Teacher Notes\n\nThis workshop starts as a look at mental health data. In the first exercise, we use the survey data as the prior probability for calculations with the binomial distribution. In the second exercise, we expand our calculations to approximations with the normal distributions. Each exercise has participants split into groups for the jigsaw approach of active learning. The groups are given various views---verbal, algebraic, symbolic, visual---and present their approach to solving the calculations to their peers. Through the pair of exercises, each participant is immersed in two of the modalities and furthermore hears from their peers about the other approaches. Toward the end of the workshop, each participant ranks their modality preferences, and will possibility feel more optimistic and enthusiastic about solving mathematical tasks in their preferred modality. These exercises are adapted from ideas from *Choosing to See: A Framework for Equity in the Math Classroom* by Pamela Seda and Kyndall Brown.\n\n## Agenda\n\n* Prompt 1 (breakout rooms)\n* Prompt 1 (return to main room)\n* Prompt 2 (breakout rooms)\n* Prompt 2 (return to main room)\n* discuss examples\n* discuss culturally relevant teaching\n\n## Advice\n\n* Each Jamboard has multiple pages\n* Sharing screen speeds up discussions\n* Choose a spokesperson for your group\n* An answer is nice, but we will like to explore how to find answers\n\n# Scenario 1: Loneliness\n\nThe BBC launched the Loneliness Experiment on Valentine’s Day of 2018 and had over 55 thousand people worldwide respond to their survey. The table below shows the proportion of respondents who said that they feel lonely “often”. Let’s call the 16-24 age group “young adults”. Suppose that in similar study, we have a sample of 5 young adults.\n\n<table style=\"border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0\" class=\"tg\"><thead><tr><th
