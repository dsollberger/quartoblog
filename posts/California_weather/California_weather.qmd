```{r}
#| message: false

library("tidyverse")
```

I want to create and visualize a simple data set for my Data Science courses (that I teach in California).

# Data Source

* University of California
* Agriculture and Natural Resources
* Statewide Integrated Pest Management Program
* https://ipm.ucanr.edu/WEATHER/wxactstnames.html

# Fixed-Width Files

Today I learned how to read `fixed-width files` in the [Tidyverse](https://readr.tidyverse.org/).  From there, I simply need to give the columns easy-to-use names.

```{r}
SF_df <- readr::read_fwf("SF_2021.txt")
colnames(SF_df) <- c("date", "time", "precipitation",
                     "check1", "high", "low", "check2")
```
