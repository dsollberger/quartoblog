            <abstract>This dataset contains the campus boundaries of Colleges and Universities of New Jersey mapped by parcel boundaries.The Colleges and Universities dataset is composed of any type of Post Secondary Education such as: colleges, universities, technical schools, trade schools, business schools, satellite (branch) campuses, etc. that grant First Professional, Associate, Bachelors, Masters, or Doctoral degrees. Secondary education facilities, Administrative offices, or Post Secondary Education facilities that are non degree granting schools are intended to be excluded from this dataset, but a few may be included. All data is non license restricted data that has been added from TGS research. </abstract>
            <purpose>The College and University file was created to help implement the NJ State Development and Redevelopment Plan by helping to identify areas where technology/health related activities and businesses could locate.</purpose>

                <srccontr>The statewide composite of parcels (cadastral) data for New Jersey was developed during the Parcels Normalization Project in 2008-2014 by the NJ Office of Information Technology, Office of GIS (NJOGIS). The normalized parcels data are compatible with the New Jersey Department of Treasury MOD-IV system currently used by Tax Assessors. This composite of parcels data serves as one of New Jersey&amp;apos;s framework GIS data sets. Stewardship and maintenance of the data will continue to be the purview of county and municipal governments, but the statewide composite will be maintained by NJOGIS. 2016 MOD IV parcels used in update.</srccontr>

                <attrlabl>CITY</attrlabl>
                <attrdef>The name of the city associated with the entity's physical address. For physical addresses that the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) delivers to, this should be a "city" acceptable to the USPS as defined in their Address Information System (AIS). Sometimes the USPS does not deliver mail to a physical address but recognizes the location (i.e., they list the location as "undeliverable"). The cities associated with these locations are acceptable. In some cases, the USPS does not recognize individual physical addresses in a city, rather, they list the city as having "General Delivery". In these cases, the city and associated zip code are acceptable (the entity's [ADDRESS] attribute will contain a street address, not "general delivery"). The entity may not actually be located within the city limits of the "city" specified in its city field. Instead, it may actually be located within the city limits of another city. In some cases, the "city" that appears in this attribute may not even be a city in an administrative sense, but it is still an acceptable "city" to the USPS. An example of this is "Notre Dame, IN". There is no city in Indiana called "Notre Dame", but this is considered an acceptable city by the USPS for any delivery going to the University of Notre Dame which is actually located in the city of South Bend. "Notre Dame", like most USPS cities, is an easily recognized place, and it gives the user of the data a good general idea of where the entity is located (if the entity is located in a small municipality, the USPS "city" may be more recognizable than the name of the municipality), and it would be part of the address one would use to send a shipment to the entity's location. Using the USPS acceptable "city" also allows someone to do a logical consistency check between the zip code and the city by using the USPS AIS.

Sometimes an entity may report a city that is not accepted by the USPS, and although TGS has tried to replace those cities with an acceptable alternative, some of them may remain in this dataset.</attrdef>
