# DDSS Lightning Talk

`Closeread` is a custom format for Quarto that enables "scrollytelling" features for HTML documents. This plug-in helps a presenter tell a narrative, quickly annotate visuals, and affect the viewing "camera" of the materials. This talk will give a brief demo of `Closeread` and discuss its applications.
