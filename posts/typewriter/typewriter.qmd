Well, I was nerd sniped.  Ryan Timpe [tweeted an image](https://mobile.twitter.com/ryantimpe/status/1558877417086885889) that made it (at first glance) appear that the [gtExtras](https://jthomasmock.github.io/gtExtras/) package allowed users to display a `gt` table as if it was made by a typewriter on classic notebook paper.  That might exist in the near future, but I thought I would try to make a similar image manually.

```{r}
library("gt")
```

```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  Period = c("0", "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6"),
  Course = c("Academic Decathlon", "Spanish 4 AP", "Calculus AP BC", "English 3 Honors", "Computer Applications", "Physics AP", "US History")
)
```

```{r}
# https://gt.rstudio.com/reference/cell_borders.html
df |>
  gt() |>
  tab_options(
    # table.background.color = "#E8EBE6",
    table.font.names = "Courier New"
  ) |>
  tab_style(
    locations = cells_body(
      columns = everything(),
      rows = everything()
    ),
    style = list(
      cell_borders(
        sides = c("top", "bottom"),
        color = "cyan",
        style = "solid"
      ),
      cell_fill(color = "#E8EBE6") #https://www.crispedge.com/color/e8ebe6/
    )
  ) |>
  tab_style(
    locations = cells_body(
      columns = "Course",
      rows = everything()
    ),
    style = list(
      cell_borders(
        sides = c("left"),
        color = "red",
        style = "solid"
      ),
      cell_fill(color = "#E8EBE6")
    )
  )
```
