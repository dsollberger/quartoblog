Today I want to try to make a `bump` plot while practicing with sports data.  The `Lahman` data set has a lot of historical data about Major League Baseball.  Data scientists have been using bump plots for a few years now, but currently I wish to credit [this code](https://github.com/AlbertRapp/PublicTidyTuesday/blob/main/2022_w28_euroflights/2022_w28_euroflights.qmd) by Albert Rapp.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library("ggbump")
library("Lahman")
library("tidyverse")
```

For today's easy foray, let us seek out the wins and losses of teams in the `Teams` data frame (I tend to call my data frames `df` for typing ease).

```{r}
df <- Teams
```

There are about 3000 observations and 48 variables.  I will need some of the column names.

```{r}
colnames(df)
```

To make a quick exploration, let us `filter` for the past 10 seasons of baseball (2012 to 2021) and `select` the columns I will use later.

```{r}
df <- Teams |>
  filter(yearID >= 2012) |>
  select(yearID, lgID, franchID, divID, Rank)
head(df)
```

To be honest, I thought I was going to have to code up some function to rank team wins within the MLB divisions, but the `Lahman` database already has that!

```{r}
df_left <- df |> filter(yearID == 2012 & lgID == "NL")
df_right <- df |> filter(yearID == 2021 & lgID == "NL")
```


```{r}
df |>
  filter(lgID == "NL") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = yearID, y = -Rank, color = franchID)) +
  geom_bump(size = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(x = yearID, y = -Rank, color = franchID),
             size = 5) +
  geom_label(aes(x = yearID, y = -Rank, label = franchID), data = df_left) +
  geom_label(aes(x = yearID, y = -Rank, label = franchID), data = df_right) +
  facet_wrap(. ~ divID, ncol = 1) +
  labs(title = "National League Standings",
       subtitle = "early draft of bump plot",
       caption = "Derek Sollberger") +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        panel.background = element_blank())
```
