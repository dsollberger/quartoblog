I saw some tweet where R programmers were asking about how to visualize folders and subfolders among their work files, so I thought I would try it out too.  One of the answers was these Stack Overflow threads:

* [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36094183/how-to-build-a-dendrogram-from-a-directory-tree](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36094183/how-to-build-a-dendrogram-from-a-directory-tree)

```{r}
library("data.tree")
library("dplyr")
```


First, I set the working directory to where I have most of my GitHub-linked files.  Next, we collect the paths (along with subdirectories)

```{r}
paths = unique(c(list.dirs(full.names = T),list.files(full.names = T)))
```

It appears that the information is collected into a data frame.

```{r}
x <- lapply(strsplit(paths, "/"), function(z) as.data.frame(t(z)))
x <- plyr::rbind.fill(x) #plyr??
```

Now, we can build the tree.

```{r}
mytree <- data.tree::as.Node(x)
```

Do we dare `print` the tree?

```{r}
plot(mytree)
```
