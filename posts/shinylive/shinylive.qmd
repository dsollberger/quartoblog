I have long wanted to include simple `Shiny` apps in my lecture notes so that I can show data science concepts to my students quickly.  Today, I want to see if `shinylive` helps me.

For now, I am following [this blog post](https://r-posts.com/add-shiny-in-quarto-blog-with-shinylive/) by jhk0530

After installing the `shinylive` Quarto extension, we add "shinylive" to the `filters` in the QMD YAML, and then start the desired code block with `{shinylive-r}`.

```{shinylive-r}
#| echo: false
#| standalone: true
#| viewerHeight: 800
library(shiny)
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Hello Shiny!"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      sliderInput(
        inputId = "bins",
        label = "Number of bins:",
        min = 1,
        max = 50,
        value = 30
      )
    ),
    mainPanel(
      plotOutput(outputId = "distPlot")
    )
  )
)
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    x <- faithful$waiting
    bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)
    hist(x,
      breaks = bins, col = "#75AADB", border = "white",
      xlab = "Waiting time to next eruption (in mins)",
      main = "Histogram of waiting times"
    )
  })
}
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```
