For years, I have been searching for the ability to make color-coded flowcharts, and I have found "graphviz online!".  We can use apps such as [this one](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/).

The code is very intuitive and easy to use.  Furthermore, there are many attribute options for nodes and edges.

```
digraph G {

"Egg" -> "Fried\nEgg"
"Potato" -> "Hashbrowns"
"Oil" -> "Hashbrowns"
"Egg" -> "Pancakes"
"Wheat\nFlour" -> "Pancakes"

"Fried\nEgg" -> "Complete\nBreakfast"
"Hashbrowns" -> "Complete\nBreakfast"
"Milk" -> "Complete\nBreakfast"
"Pancakes" -> "Complete\nBreakfast"


"Egg" [shape = circle, style = filled, fillcolor = "#59C9F1"]
"Potato" [shape = circle, style = filled, fillcolor = "#59C9F1"]
"Oil" [shape = square, style = filled, fillcolor = "#DDA059"]
"Wheat\nFlour" [shape = circle, style = filled, fillcolor = "#59C9F1"]

"Fried\nEgg" [shape = square, style = filled, fillcolor = "#DDA059"]
"Milk" [shape = circle, style = filled, fillcolor = "#59C9F1"]
"Hashbrowns" [shape = square, style = filled, fillcolor = "#DDA059"]
"Pancakes" [shape = square, style = filled, fillcolor = "#DDA059"]
"Complete\nBreakfast" [shape = hexagon, style = filled, fillcolor = " #FFD921"]
}
```
