One of my silly side-projects is to organize the dependency chart in the Settlement Survival video game into a `mermaid` diagram (or a similar flow chart).  

# Game Start

Today, I will start with the beginning of the game---that is, what tends to be built in the first "year".  I am going to take some liberties and actually *add* more prerequisites in the beginning (otherwise, the graph simply starts with about 12 unlinked nodes).

```{r}
library("DiagrammeR")
```

```{r}
my_plot <- DiagrammeR::mermaid("
  graph TD
  start[Select Location]
  
  house1[1 House]
  farms[2 Standard Fields]
  water[Big Well]
  forest_hut[Forester's Hut]
  gather_hut[Gatherer's Hut]
  hunter_hut[Hunter's Hut]
  chopping_house[Chopping House]

")
```

```{r}

```

## Welcoming New Settlers

Next, our goal is to build a city hall and support the new residents.  At first, I wanted to get the branches to align with the 8 categories of tech trees, but the features in the Processing and Agriculture trees will have to come a bit later (for example: the apiaries needed clay from the sand mining, while processing needs farm and animal products in general.)

## Trading

Going into Year 3, I like to build toward making my settlement into a trading post.  It might take a few years to get the population to support caravans.

```{r}

## Gem Mining

Around Year 10 (and having an at least level 3 diplomatic relationship with Rania), I start building the gem mines.  Since it is still early in the settlement development, I gather the building kits, steel, and lanterns from trades.
