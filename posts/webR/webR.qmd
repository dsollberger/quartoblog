`webR` is a Quarto extension made by The Coatless Professor that allows users to type code right there in a webpage.

* In the terminal, type `quarto add coatless/quarto-webr` and press Enter. Allow the installation to proceed.
    
    * [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoRR2S5lLvk) by The Coatless Professor

After installing the extension, the `extensions` appears in my `quartoblog` folder (i.e. not just the folder for this blog post)
