# Goal

Here, I hope to learn about the reasonably understand the proof(s) of the **Four-Color Theorem**.  I myself have a master's degree in applied mathematics, but it has been many years since I have taken Abstract Algebra.  Also, I never got far into topology.

Now, I am hoping to use artificial intelligence tools to help me 

* state the Four-Color Theorem
* summarize the history of its solving
* outline a study plan to approach the materials (proofs and lemmas)
* form examples to understand the abstract algebra concepts
